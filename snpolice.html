        <h2>Fuck the SNPolice</h2>
        <hr style="width: 200px">
        <p>Hey guys.</p>
        <p>So,</p>
        <br>
        <p>Nicola Sturgeon just got put on a show/witch trial for denying government access
            to an abuser.
        </p>
        <p>To be fair she didn't have to deal with corroboration, not proven, prima nocta or
            undercover cops in an actual Scottish courtroom and I doubt she ever has if she still
            thinks she's been doing a good job for the past 22 years.
        </p>
        <p>JK Rowling (1 million to the NO campaign), Alex Salmond (12 women, that we've heard of),
            Joanna Cherry (probably pissed cause I look better than her in a dress) and apparently
            one of the founders of Glasgow Rape Crisis (the workers there don't seem to have a problem
            with trannies) all want the same thing: 0 trannies in an independent Scotland.
        </p>
        <p>The SNP NEC is a pact between old abusive men and old abusive women, they almost just re-legalised
            trans hate crimes in Scotland. And that was just Humza Yousaf, thank fuck he can't get anything done.
        </p>
        <p>I used to be pro-independence. Still am if it were just Nicky doing it. But Scottish people don't need
            a law making them totally fucking independent, they need a remotely functional government.
        </p>
        <p>Time for a proper green revolution. Abolish the cops, get some city centre accessible housing for old people,
            stop the Chinese State (I usually would mean Taiwan, I don't mean Taiwan this time) extracting hundreds of millions
            of barrels of oil from our East Coast.
        </p>
        <p>Decriminalise drugs so people can get help and not pumped full of methadone, hate. Footballs not knives
            please.
        </p>
        <p>End the food banks. They don't work. The homeless need homes, not tins.</p>
        <p>Do you know who the SNP equalities convenor is? Lynne Anderson, someone who wants to take the T out of LGB.
            She has spoken at groups who state that trans women are men. The equalities convenor. She once said that medical
            students being taught that trans women are women weren't capable of listening to science or performing critical
            thinking skills.
        </p>
        <p>Nah mate. Had enough to be honest with you.</p>
        <p>Also while I'm at it, you might want to ask Edinburgh University to start publishing their suicide rate.</p>
